# R36 Recomposition Notes
- Applied full composition reset: widened spines, explicit 2:1 arch layout, normalized card heights, fixed overlapping headings, reduced redundant gutters.
- Token usage: container widths (SpineSystem), spacing tokens in global.css.
- Next: R37 will refine typographic scale, optical alignment, and micro-interactions.
