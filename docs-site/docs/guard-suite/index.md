The GuardSuite docs below now satisfy the Section 7 requirements from the GuardSuite Master Spec. Each page ties the static marketing routes (`/products/vectorscan`, `/products/vectorguard`, `/launch/vectorscan`) back to executable guidance so analysts can trace every CTA to a deterministic workflow.
