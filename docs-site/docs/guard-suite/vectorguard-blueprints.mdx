description: Zero-Trust blueprint catalog that converts VectorScan findings into automated guardrails.

## Overview

VectorGuard converts VectorScan findings into executable Zero-Trust blueprints without exposing the proprietary Rego or IAM modules that power them. The GuardSuite Master Spec requires two catalog SKUs plus a shared promotion flow that produces GuardScore/GuardBoard evidence. Use this page whenever you need to explain what the paid upgrade unlocks or how procurement should evaluate a policy pack.

## Blueprint Catalog

| Blueprint | Price | `blueprintId` | Coverage | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zero-Trust Lite | $79 | `GV-LITE-001` | Encryption defaults, tagging parity, IAM least-privilege checks for AWS & Terraform Cloud. | Markdown + JSON ledgers, FixPack references, GuardScore delta summary. |
| Enterprise Kit | $449 | `GV-ENT-010` | Everything from Lite plus drift remediation modules, GuardBoard ingest packs, auto-rollbacks, and SLA-backed GuardScore metrics. | GuardBoard bundle (`guardboard.json`), signed ledger, remediation runbooks. |
| GuardBoard Accelerator (bundle tie-in) | Included in $1,499 Full Suite Pack | `GV-BUNDLE-025` | Connects GuardBoard, GuardScore, and bundle automation (ComputeGuard, ModelGuard). | Combined GuardBoard + GuardScore artifacts for exec reporting. |

All blueprints share:

- `supportedClouds`: `aws`, `aws_gov`, and Terraform Cloud pipelines.
- FixPack mapping so remediation hints like `fixpack:PILLAR-XXX-000` remain consistent across the platform.
- Channel metadata (`gumroad`, `github_marketplace`, `direct`) so finance can reconcile SKUs.

## Promotion Flow

```bash
cat artifacts/vectorscan.json \
	| vectorguard promote --blueprint zero-trust-lite \
	--channel gumroad --export guardboard.json
```

1. VectorScan writes `findingId`, `policy`, and `upgradeHint` fields.
2. `vectorguard promote` resolves the hint, validates licensing, and attaches required Terraform/IAM modules.
3. The command emits GuardScore deltas and GuardBoard bundles without re-scanning the plan, satisfying the "no re-upload" promise.
4. Optional `--apply` triggers drift remediation using the same FixPack metadata referenced by the Pillar evaluator.

## Evidence & Reporting

- **Lite SKU:** produces Markdown + JSON ledgers with `planHash`, `commitSha`, `severityTotals`, and `badgeEligibility` so compliance teams can file proof-of-control.
- **Enterprise SKU:** adds GuardBoard ingest bundles, signed GuardScore metrics, and auto-generated rollback scripts.
- **Bundle consumers:** combine GuardBoard output with ComputeGuard/ModelGuard metrics to show a unified GuardSuite posture.
