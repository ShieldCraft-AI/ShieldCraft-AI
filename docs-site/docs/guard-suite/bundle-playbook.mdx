## Overview

The GuardSuite launch plan (Master Spec Section 7, "Becoming enterprise-ready") requires a scripted funnel from free CLI adoption to bundle conversion. This page explains the catalog (Full Suite Pack, Pro Kit, Enterprise Kit) and how pre-flight upsells fit into procurement reviews.

## Contract Requirements

- **Bundle Transparency:** Publish included SKUs (`includes` array from `guardSuitePricing`) plus one-time vs subscription pricing.
- **Upsell Hook:** $19 Pre-flight Check must be offered immediately after purchase with deterministic revenue tracking.
- **Channel Handling:** Document fee impact for Gumroad, GitHub Marketplace, and direct invoices so finance teams can reconcile totals.

## Feature Snapshot

- Full Suite Pack ($1,499) bundles VectorScan, VectorGuard, ComputeGuard, ModelGuard, GuardBoard Lite, and GuardScore automation.
- Pro Kit focuses on Zero-Trust blueprints + remediation SDKs for teams not ready for GuardBoard.
- Enterprise Kit introduces GuardBoard Enterprise, GuardScore SLAs, and managed remediation cadences.
- Affiliate and marketplace fee disclosures (20% lifetime, 70% boosted on launch-week Gumroad) inline with marketing checklist.

## Bundle Comparison

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

This table mirrors the GuardSuite Master Spec pricing and ensures the docs remain the single source-of-truth for SKUs, buyers, and activation workflows.

## GuardBoard Snapshot

> _Screenshot placeholder_: GuardBoard Lite dashboard capture will be attached once the design team exports the final PNG; keeping the note here maintains the spec breadcrumb without blocking parity.

- **GuardBoard Lite** ships with the Full Suite Pack and offers read-only dashboards for GuardScore deltas, FixPack adoption, and evidence aging. It consumes the same JSON emitted by VectorScan, ComputeProbe, and ModelCheck so no extra ingestion plumbing is required.
- **GuardBoard Enterprise** (Enterprise Kit + Full Pack) layers SLA tracking, remediation cadences, and badge eligibility exports for compliance teams. Docs reference this section so revenue operations can cite a canonical description during audits.

## Procurement Workflow

1. **VectorScan download** — visitors land on `/products/vectorscan`, install the CLI, and optionally add the $19 Pre-flight Check.
2. **VectorGuard promotion** — VectorScan findings link to `/products/vectorguard`, where users pick Lite ($79) or Enterprise ($449) SKUs.
3. **Bundle CTA** — After purchasing any Enterprise SKU, the thank-you flow surfaces the $1,499 Full GuardSuite Pack with a 25% discount and affiliate attribution.
4. **Fulfillment** — Docs instruct customers to pull assets from `dist/guardsuite/` via signed download links; GuardBoard licenses are delivered as JSON manifests with checksum metadata for audit trails.

## Channel & Upsell Tracking

- **UTM discipline:** All docs CTAs include `?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=bundle-playbook&utm_campaign=guardsuite-q4` so marketing can attribute conversions.
- **Affiliate commissions:** Highlight the default 20% lifetime commission and note the 70% launch-week boost on Gumroad; finance references this section when reconciling payouts.
- **Marketplace fees:** GitHub Marketplace introduces a 5% fee; Gumroad subtracts variable processing (estimate 8%). The playbook calls this out so pricing math stays transparent.
- **Audit hooks:** Every upsell references GuardScore ledger IDs, ensuring procurement teams can map purchases to compliance evidence without extra follow-up.
