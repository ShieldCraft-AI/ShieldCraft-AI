description: Zero-setup Terraform plan scanner that initiates the GuardSuite upgrade funnel.

## Why VectorScan Exists

VectorScan is the GuardSuite entry point promised in Section 7 of the GuardSuite Master Spec. It scans a deterministic `tfplan.json`, emits GuardScore-ready evidence, and keeps your Terraform plan local so no secrets leave the build environment. The scanner is:

- **Zero setup.** `pip install vectorscan` pulls a single dependency bundle with vendored policies.
- **Network silent.** Runs with `--no-network` by default to satisfy the "no account, no upload" clause.
- **Upgrade aware.** Every finding includes `findingId`, `policy`, `severity`, and `upgradeHint` so `vectorguard promote` can act on the same artifact later.

## Installation & First Scan

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade vectorscan
vectorscan plan/tfplan.json \
	--format json --out artifacts/vectorscan.json \
	--finding-prefix VS-2025Q4
```

- `--format` accepts `json`, `sarif`, or `markdown` to satisfy CI, GitHub Code Scanning, and executive snapshot requirements.
- `--finding-prefix` matches the spec's requirement to stamp findings with campaign metadata (HN launch, marketplace, etc.).
- Exit codes: `0` (clean), `3` (findings), `4` (schema/plan error) so pipelines can halt deterministically.

### Optional flags

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--explain` | Annotates each policy with remediation guidance and GuardSuite blueprint IDs. |
| `--diff` | Shows the Terraform resource delta so analysts can confirm accuracy before promotion. |
| `--promote` | Creates a promotion bundle for VectorGuard without requiring immediate network egress. |

## Output Anatomy

```json
{
	"findingId": "VS-2025Q4-001",
	"policy": "encryption-required",
	"resource": "aws_s3_bucket.data",
