title: Multi-Agent Orchestration Core
description: Deterministic AI agent pipeline for GuardSuite approvals.
slug: /ai/multi-agent-orchestration
---

ShieldCraft orchestrates multiple deterministic agents to simulate the GuardSuite approval flow without calling external models. The orchestrator executes locally defined handlers, each consuming the shared incident plan and prior outputs.

## Agents

1. **threat_intel** — Normalizes severity, deduplicates signal sources, and highlights watchlist matches.
2. **remediation_planner** — Builds step-by-step actions for SecOps and Platform teams using the intel rollup.
3. **risk_reviewer** — Scores readiness/residual risk and lists approvers before deployment.

Each handler runs as pure Python logic with no randomness, ensuring consistent snapshots in CI.

## Inputs & Outputs

- Inputs: JSON plan files such as `tests/fixtures/ai/sample_plan.json` containing severity, affected assets, and signal metadata.
- Outputs: `MultiAgentOrchestrator.run(plan)` returns ordered agent trace plus the final recommendation consumed by approval workflows.

## Determinism Guarantees

- Agents execute in a fixed topological order with guarded dependency validation.
- Severity scores map to fixed integers, and remediation steps are sorted by asset order.
- Re-running the orchestrator on the same plan yields identical JSON, enabling snapshot tests or GitHub Actions gating.

## Usage

```python
from ai_core.multi_agent import MultiAgentOrchestrator

plan = {...}  # load deterministic plan fixture
result = MultiAgentOrchestrator().run(plan)
print(result["final_recommendation"])
```

Use the orchestrator output to feed downstream approval or reporting systems while keeping the AI governance story auditable.
