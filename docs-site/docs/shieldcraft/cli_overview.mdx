title: ShieldCraft CLI Overview
description: Entry point for deterministic platform automation commands.
slug: /shieldcraft/cli-overview
---

The ShieldCraft CLI provides a stable, zero-network surface for local workflows. The initial milestone introduces a single command plus standard global flags so downstream teams can begin wiring automation without waiting for evaluator or registry integrations.

## Commands

| Command | Description | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shieldcraft --version` | Prints the deterministic CLI version (sourced from `CLI_VERSION`). | Plain text `0.1.0` |
| `shieldcraft --help` | Displays the usage banner for all commands. | Plain text |
| `shieldcraft info` | Emits platform metadata (name, version, docs URL, description). | Human-readable text |
| `shieldcraft info --json` | Same metadata as JSON with stable key ordering for scripting. | JSON |

## Design Notes

- The CLI uses a tiny command map inside `src/cli/main.py` so new commands can be registered without introducing external dependencies.
- JSON mode always sorts keys to keep snapshot diffs deterministic.
- The CLI intentionally omits GuardSuite evaluator references; it focuses on ShieldCraft platform metadata until future milestones expand the command surface.
