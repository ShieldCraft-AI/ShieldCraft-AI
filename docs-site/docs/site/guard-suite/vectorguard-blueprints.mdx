title: VectorGuard Policy Packs
description: Map VectorScan findings into Zero-Trust blueprints and enterprise kits.
---

VectorGuard blueprints package Terraform modules, Rego packs, and remediation playbooks so you can enforce drift findings immediately. They exist in two tiers so teams can swipe a credit card ($79) or raise a PO ($449) without rewriting policy.

## SKUs

| Tier | Price | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lite Blueprint | $79 | Terraform modules, Rego pack, scorecard template |
| Enterprise Kit | $449 | Lite + automation runbooks, identity blast-radius insights |

## Promote a finding

```bash
vectorguard promote finding-123 --policy zero-trust-s3
```

The command bundles remediation assets, signs scorecards, and attaches ledger evidence ready for auditors.

## Affiliate & upsell strategy

- Affiliates earn 20% lifetime on VectorGuard purchases (70% boosted during early launch weeks).
- Trigger the optional $19 Pre-flight Check on the thank-you page to boost AOV.
- After 48 hours, email Lite buyers with an offer to credit their $79 toward the $449 kit.
