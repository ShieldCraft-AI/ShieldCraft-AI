title: VectorScan Overview
description: Install, configure, and run the free Terraform plan scanner that powers GuardSuite funnels.
---

VectorScan ships as a zero-setup CLI. It runs locally, reads `tfplan.json`, and emits findings that map directly to VectorGuard policy packs. Use it as your free lead magnet before promoting guardrails to paid SKUs.

## Install

```bash
pip install vectorscan
```

## Run

```bash
vectorscan ./plan/tfplan.json --format sarif --out findings.sarif
```

### Flags you will use daily

- `--format json|sarif|markdown` – choose the artifact for CI, GitHub code scanning, or executive recaps.
- `--explain` – add remediation notes and blast-radius estimates inline.
- `--promote` – send findings straight into GuardSuite APIs once credentials are configured.

## Output formats

- JSON (machine-to-machine)
- SARIF (GitHub code scanning)
- Markdown (executive recap)

Next: promote any finding into VectorGuard using `vectorguard promote <findingId>`.

## Upgrade funnel

1. Run VectorScan locally or in CI.
2. Share the Markdown artifact with leadership.
3. Promote the noisier findings into the $79 VectorGuard Zero-Trust blueprint.
4. When you need automation, step up to the $449 enterprise kit or the $1,499 full bundle.

> **Tip:** Keep VectorScan installed even after you upgrade. GuardSuite never locks the CLI behind a paywall.
