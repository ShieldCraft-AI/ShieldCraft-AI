title: CLI Guardrail Layer
description: Wire VectorScan, ComputeProbe, and ModelCheck CLIs into CI/CD and Terraform workflows.
---

GuardSuite CLIs run locally or in CI and never transmit sensitive IaC or data. Use them to enforce guardrails before a change merges and to seed the GuardSuite upsell funnel.

## CI snippet

```yaml
steps:
  - name: VectorScan tfplan
    run: |
      pip install vectorscan
      terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
      vectorscan tfplan.json --format json --out findings.json
```

## Promotion hook

Pipe the JSON output into VectorGuard or ComputeGuard to auto-create remediation stories.

```bash
cat findings.json | vectorguard promote --auto
```

## CLI lineup

| CLI | Purpose | Upsell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vectorscan` | Terraform drift + tagging detector | VectorGuard ($79/$449) |
| `computeprobe` | GPU & inference spend watchdog | ComputeGuard ($129/$599) |
| `modelcheck` | Bias/safety regression kit | ModelGuard ($199/$799) |

Pair each CLI with UTM-tagged launch links so you can attribute conversions from Hacker News, LinkedIn, or marketplaces back to the right surface.
