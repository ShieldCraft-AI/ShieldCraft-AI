## Status
Proposed

## Context
ShieldCraft AI needs a clear, opinionated starting point that balances speed to value with production-grade guardrails. Our audience ranges from technical buyers to security leaders who expect:

- A credible, cost-aware entry point (Starter)
- A pathway to operational scale and governance (Growth)
- An enterprise posture with controls, resiliency, and predictable spend (Enterprise)

AWS managed services provide the shortest path to impact and the strongest integration surface for security workloads (IAM, CloudWatch, EventBridge, Control Tower, etc.). A tiered architecture also simplifies demos, pricing conversations, and portfolio storytelling without diluting technical rigor.

### Decision Drivers
- Reduce time-to-first-value while preserving an upgrade path
- Keep monthly run-rate understandable and defensible per tier
- Align with AWS-native services to lower integration risk
- Make capabilities discoverable and incremental (no big-bang)

## Decision
Adopt a three-tier architecture with progressively richer capabilities and guardrails. Default to AWS managed services and compose capabilities behind stable interfaces.

### Scope by Tier
- Starter
	- Core ingestion (S3, EventBridge, Lambda)
	- Foundational observability (CloudWatch)
	- Minimal governance (IAM, CloudTrail)
	- Low monthly footprint; optimized for onboarding and demos

- Growth
	- Data processing at scale (Glue, Step Functions)
	- Lake governance (Lake Formation)
	- Security posture improvements (Security Hub, Config)
	- Run-rate still predictable; adds SLAs and automation

- Enterprise
	- Resilience and performance upgrades (WAF, MSK where applicable)
	- Multi-account governance (Control Tower compatibility)
	- Full-spectrum observability and FinOps
	- Enterprise support assumptions and change controls

### Nonâ€‘Goals
- Multi-cloud baseline from day one
- Re-implementing managed capabilities where AWS has a strong service fit

## Alternatives Considered
- Single-tier MVP only
	- Pro: Simpler story and ops
	- Con: No upgrade path; weak enterprise signal
- Custom/k8s-first stack
	- Pro: Portability
	- Con: Slower value, higher undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Multi-cloud baseline
	- Pro: Avoids lock-in
	- Con: Higher complexity; weak integration with AWS-native controls

## Rollout Plan
1) Land Starter with crisp defaults and one-click enablement
2) Add Growth capabilities behind flags; prove easy upgrades
3) Validate Enterprise with governance controls and add-ons (e.g., MSK) where discovery warrants

## Measuring Success
- Time-to-first-successful-ingestion < 15 minutes (Starter)
- P90 pipeline success and visibility (Growth)
- Policy conformance and change management metrics (Enterprise)

## Consequences
- Clear packaging and pricing narrative that maps to real AWS usage
- Accelerated demos and stakeholder alignment
- Accepts service affinity to AWS in exchange for speed and governance
