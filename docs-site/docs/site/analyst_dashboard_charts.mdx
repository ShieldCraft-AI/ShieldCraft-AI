This stub document records the static requirements and references for the Analyst Dashboard visualizations that satisfy **SC-APP-UI-003**. The prototype does not fetch runtime data; each chart is hydrated from docs artifacts and fixtures referenced below.

## Components

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="score" label="Score Trend" default>
    - Component: `ScoreTrendChart`
    - Source: `docs/specs/guardscore_snapshot.md` (deterministic guardscore sample)
    - Notes: Inline sparkline SVG with median badges for each severity band.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="volume" label="Evidence Volume">
    - Component: `EvidenceVolumeBars`
    - Source: `docs/github/analyst_evidence_feed.md`
    - Notes: Static 3-month payload counts highlight ingestion reliability.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

Both charts render inside `ChartsPanel` on `/dashboard`. They provide storytelling hooks for analysts demoing score movements and evidence intake without needing backend connectivity.
