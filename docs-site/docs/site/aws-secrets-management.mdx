This page summarizes ShieldCraft AI's approach to secrets management and serves as a placeholder to resolve links from other docs. A more detailed guide exists in the repository under `docs-site/docs/security/aws-secrets-management.md`.

- Centralized secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- Environment-specific secret namespaces (dev, staging, prod)
- No secret anti-patterns (do not store ARNs as secret values)
- Retrieval via IAM roles; no long-lived static credentials

For the full, richly formatted version, see the security doc in the repo. This MDX page will be expanded as content is consolidated into the site.
