## Status
Proposed

## Context
ShieldCraft AI needs semantic search across alerts, artifacts, and knowledge objects. Early workloads prioritize developer velocity and modest scale; later stages may demand hybrid query (BM25 + ANN), multi-tenant isolation, and managed high availability.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Integration effort and developer productivity
- Hybrid search support (keyword + vector)
- Scale characteristics and operational overhead
- Cost efficiency for low/medium traffic
- Managed service availability on AWS

## Decision
Start with PGVector on PostgreSQL for speed and simplicity. Define a small vector store interface so we can swap implementations without invasive refactors. Keep Amazon OpenSearch Service as the scale/enterprise path when:
- corpus size, QPS, or latency SLOs demand it, or
- hybrid search and per-tenant isolation benefits outweigh operational cost.

### Rationale
- PGVector
	- Simple to stand up and operate; good developer ergonomics
	- Cost-efficient for early and medium stages
	- Sufficient for embeddings search, reranking, and prototypes
- OpenSearch
	- Strong hybrid search, facets, aggregations, and security plugins
	- Managed scaling and integrations with AWS ecosystem
	- Heavier operational profile and cost floor

## Alternatives Considered
- PGVector only
	- Pro: Minimum surface area
	- Con: Limits hybrid/search features at scale
- OpenSearch only
	- Pro: Powerful features from the start
	- Con: Higher cost/ops; slower onboarding
- Managed third-party vector DB
	- Pro: Feature-rich ANN
	- Con: Extra vendor; networking and cost complexity

## Migration Path
1) Implement a thin repository interface (insert/query/delete) in `ai_core/vector_store.py`
2) Provide `pgvector` and `opensearch` backends behind a factory
3) Add data export/import scripts to reindex embeddings
4) Gate selection via config/env, default to PGVector

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Query latency spikes on PGVector at larger scale
	- Mitigation: Add indexes, batching, and move hot paths to OpenSearch when thresholds are crossed
- Risk: Feature gaps (filters, aggregations)
	- Mitigation: Hybrid approach: use Postgres + a lightweight keyword index, or move to OpenSearch

## Success Metrics
- P95 query latency within target SLO at current scale
- Swap backend without API changes to callers
- Controlled infra cost trajectory from dev to prod
