## 1. Objectives

## 2. Current State Summary (ShieldCraft AI)

* Navigation includes: Home, Platform, Pricing, Documentation, Infrastructure, etc.
* Tone is enterprise-first and technically authoritative.

Delayed ~7–10s.
Shown once via cookie.
Only on marketing pages - not docs.

### ✔ Integrate Into Documentation

A new "GuardSuite" section with pages covering:

* VectorScan Overview
