# Security Policy

GuardSuite tracks security findings in this repository. If you discover a vulnerability, please open a private issue or email security@shieldsuite.example with detailed reproduction steps so we can respond quickly. Do not disclose issues publicly until we have confirmed and shipped a fix.

All contributions must follow the GuardSuite Master Spec baseline controls and remediation workflow described in `docs/Guard Suite.txt`.
